The Platform Governance Archive (PGA) is a data repository and platform that collects and curates policies of major social media platforms in a long-term perspective. When have YouTube and Instagram introduced hate speech policies? How have misinformation policies changed over time? With the help of the archive, researchers, journalists and the public can answer their questions on how platforms order and govern communication and interaction in our societies, and hold those powerful new institutions accountable.

Here on this Github section you find the repositories for the historical dataset (until Q4/2021). This part of the archive consists of two repositories: 

- **[/pga-corpus](https://github.com/PlatformGovernanceArchive/pga-corpus)** (the final corpus of all identified policy versions)
- **[/pga-workbench](https://github.com/PlatformGovernanceArchive/pga-workbench)** (providing tools, and data that we used in the research process)

Please also consult our ongoing data collection since 2022 as part of a collaboration with the [Open Terms Archive](https://opentermsarchive.org) at [https://github.com/openTermsArchive/pga-versions](https://github.com/openTermsArchive/pga-versions).
